> In 1984, while a graduate student in mathematics and in the relatively new Computer Science Department at the University of California at Berkeley, Fritz Kunze founded Franz, Inc. along with a few fellow students and one professor. Their mission was to commercialize a programming language known as Lisp (originally LISP for LISt Processor), which for a moment in time was the most widely used in the world for artificial intelligence and expert system applications.
